Dhawan also picked up the man of the match for his heroics in the Test.<br><br>India trumped the hosts inside four days and that gave them enough time to try their hands at video games. In a picture uploaded on social media by batman Rohit Sharma, the southpaw is seen taking the mickey out of Cheteshwar Pujara and KL Rahul and it seems that he beat them in FIFA very comfortably.<br><br>The Second test is going to start on 3rd July and once again the eye will be on Shikhar Dhawan who have played a magnificent inning of 190 in first inning of first test match.</h4></div>
